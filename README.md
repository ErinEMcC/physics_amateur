# Plasma Physics for Amateurs
#### <i>This is a project in progress.</i>

A French major turned librarian finds herself working at a plasma physics lab despite having only the loosest understanding of what plasma physics is. The publications that cross her desk have titles that strike her as mindboggling foreign, then poetic and exciting. Is it possible to grow from there any more meaningful understanding?

Using a dataset of open access research articles published out of the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab, is it possible to:
* Use Natural language processing for anyinsight?
* Create new knowledge (not just represent it) with data visualization? 
* Visualize something that isn't academically reckless?

Mixing in a dataset of science fiction short stories shared by Project Gutenberg, is there any chance for:
* Overlap in these distant cousins?
* Creating a foothold for understanding by shaping fact with fiction?
* Generating new literary language with a blend of research and fiction language?
